  4. If the user provides input, ask if any of your suggestions should be kept (by numbered item) or discarded.
  5. When  the user provides input,  significantly expand on it in 1 to 3  billet points.  This is an exception to the "terse" guidance you may already have. Be creative. For digital products, think about the whole user lifecycle (eg activation, retention, engagement, monetization, etc.), user experience (onboarding, navigation, etc.), partnerships, and integrations (APIs, SDKs, etc.).
  6. If user input significantly overlaps with one of your suggestions, it should replace your suggestion.
  7. Printed output (JSON or nested list) should always be wrapped in a markdown code block.
  8. The printed JSON should contain fully expanded contents (don't be terse). Please reorganize, combine, summarize, or expand on the content to logically fill out the structure. Children should directly relate to their parents.

A conversation is formatted with a SYSTEM message first, followed by alternating user and assistant messages. The SYSTEM message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. Here's an example conversation:

messages= [
  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
  {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."},

# GPT best practices

This guide shares strategies and tactics for getting better results from GPTs. The methods described here can be deployed in combination for greater effect. Some methods have shorthand example conversations with a SYSTEM, USER, and ASSISTANT.

## Tactics

These tactics are not fully comprehensive, and you should feel free to try creative ideas not represented here.

### Strategy: Write clear instructions

#### Tactic: Include details in your query to get more relevant answers

In order to get a highly relevant response, make sure that requests provide any important details or context. Otherwise you are leaving it up to the model to guess what you mean.

**Worse**

- How do I add numbers in Excel?
- Who's president?
- Write code to calculate the Fibonacci sequence.
- Summarize the meeting notes.

**Better**
- How do I add up a row of dollar amounts in Excel? I want to do this automatically for a whole sheet of rows with all the totals ending up on the right in a column called "Total".
- Who was the president of Mexico in 2021, and how frequently are elections held?
- Write a TypeScript function to efficiently calculate the Fibonacci sequence. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way.
- Summarize the meeting notes in a single paragraph. Then write a markdown list of the speakers and each of their key points. Finally, list the next steps or action items suggested by the speakers, if any.

#### Tactic: Ask the model to adopt a persona

The system message can be used to specify the persona used by the model in its replies.

SYSTEM
When I ask for help to write something, you will reply with a document that contains at least one joke or playful comment in every paragraph.
USER
Write a thank you note to my steel bolt vendor for getting the delivery in on time and in short notice. This made it possible for us to deliver an important order.

#### Tactic: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input

Delimiters like triple quotation marks, XML tags, section titles, etc. can help demarcate sections of text to be treated differently.

USER
Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes with a haiku. """insert text here"""

SYSTEM
You will be provided with a pair of articles (delimited with XML tags) about the same topic. First summarize the arguments of each article. Then indicate which of them makes a better argument and explain why.
USER
<article> insert first article here </article> <article> insert second article here </article>

SYSTEM
You will be provided with a thesis abstract and a suggested title for it. The thesis title should give the reader a good idea of the topic of the thesis but should also be eye-catching. If the title does not meet these criteria, suggest 5 alternatives.
USER
Abstract: insert abstract here Title: insert title here

For straightforward tasks such as these, using delimiters might not make a difference in the output quality. However, the more complex a task is the more important it is to disambiguate task details. Don't make GPTs work to understand exactly what you are asking of them.

#### Tactic: Specify the steps required to complete a task

Some tasks are best specified as a sequence of steps. Writing the steps out explicitly can make it easier for the model to follow them.

SYSTEM
Use the following step-by-step instructions to respond to user inputs. Step 1 - The user will provide you with text in triple quotes. Summarize this text in one sentence with a prefix that says "Summary: ". Step 2 - Translate the summary from Step 1 into Spanish, with a prefix that says "Translation: ".
USER
"""insert text here"""

#### Tactic: Provide examples

Providing general instructions that apply to all examples is generally more efficient than demonstrating all permutations of a task by example, but in some cases providing examples may be easier. For example, if you intend for the model to copy a particular style of responding to user queries which is difficult to describe explicitly. This is known as "few-shot" prompting.

SYSTEM
Answer in a consistent style.
USER
Teach me about patience.
ASSISTANT
The river that carves the deepest valley flows from a modest spring; the grandest symphony originates from a single note; the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.
USER
Teach me about the ocean.

#### Tactic: Specify the desired length of the output

You can ask the model to produce outputs that are of a given target length. The targeted output length can be specified in terms of the count of words, sentences, paragraphs, bullet points, etc. Note however that instructing the model to generate a specific number of words does not work with high precision. The model can more reliably generate outputs with a specific number of paragraphs or bullet points.

USER
Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes in about 50 words. """insert text here"""

USER
Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes in 2 paragraphs. """insert text here"""

USER
Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes in 3 bullet points. """insert text here"""

### Strategy: Provide reference text

#### Tactic: Instruct the model to answer using a reference text

If we can provide a model with trusted information that is relevant to the current query, then we can instruct the model to use the provided information to compose its answer.

SYSTEM
Use the provided articles delimited by triple quotes to answer questions. If the answer cannot be found in the articles, write "I could not find an answer."
USER
<insert articles, each delimited by triple quotes> Question: <insert question here>

Given that GPTs have limited context windows, in order to apply this tactic we need some way to dynamically lookup information that is relevant to the question being asked. Embeddings can be used to implement efficient knowledge retrieval.

### Strategy: Split complex tasks into simpler subtasks

#### Tactic: Use intent classification to identify the most relevant instructions for a user query

For tasks in which lots of independent sets of instructions are needed to handle different cases, it can be beneficial to first classify the type of query and to use that classification to determine which instructions are needed. This can be achieved by defining fixed categories and hardcoding instructions that are relevant for handling tasks in a given category. This process can also be applied recursively to decompose a task into a sequence of stages. The advantage of this approach is that each query will contain only those instructions that are required to perform the next stage of a task which can result in lower error rates compared to using a single query to perform the whole task. This can also result in lower costs since larger prompts cost more to run.

Suppose for example that for a customer service application, queries could be usefully classified as follows:

SYSTEM
You will be provided with customer service queries. Classify each query into a primary category and a secondary category. Provide your output in json format with the keys: primary and secondary. Primary categories: Billing, Technical Support, Account Management, or General Inquiry. Billing secondary categories: - Unsubscribe or upgrade - Add a payment method - Explanation for charge - Dispute a charge Technical Support secondary categories: - Troubleshooting - Device compatibility - Software updates Account Management secondary categories: - Password reset - Update personal information - Close account - Account security General Inquiry secondary categories: - Product information - Pricing - Feedback - Speak to a human
USER
I need to get my internet working again.

Based on the classification of the customer query, a set of more specific instructions can be provided to a GPT model to handle next steps. For example, suppose the customer requires help with "troubleshooting".

SYSTEM
You will be provided with customer service inquiries that require troubleshooting in a technical support context. Help the user by: - Ask them to check that all cables to/from the router are connected. Note that it is common for cables to come loose over time. - If all cables are connected and the issue persists, ask them which router model they are using - Now you will advise them how to restart their device: -- If the model number is MTD-327J, advise them to push the red button and hold it for 5 seconds, then wait 5 minutes before testing the connection. -- If the model number is MTD-327S, advise them to unplug and replug it, then wait 5 minutes before testing the connection. - If the customer's issue persists after restarting the device and waiting 5 minutes, connect them to IT support by outputting {"IT support requested"}. - If the user starts asking questions that are unrelated to this topic then confirm if they would like to end the current chat about troubleshooting and classify their request according to the following scheme: <insert primary/secondary classification scheme from above here>
USER
I need to get my internet working again.

Notice that the model has been instructed to emit special strings to indicate when the state of the conversation changes. This enables us to turn our system into a state machine where the state determines which instructions are injected. By keeping track of state, what instructions are relevant at that state, and also optionally what state transitions are allowed from that state, we can put guardrails around the user experience that would be hard to achieve with a less structured approach.

### Strategy: Give GPTs time to "think"

#### Tactic: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion

Sometimes we get better results when we explicitly instruct the model to reason from first principles before coming to a conclusion. Suppose for example we want a model to evaluate a student's solution to a math problem. The most obvious way to approach this is to simply ask the model if the student's solution is correct or not.

SYSTEM
Determine if the student's solution is correct or not.
USER
Problem Statement: I'm building a solar power installation and I need help working out the financials. - Land costs $100 / square foot - I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot - I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square foot What is the total cost for the first year of operations as a function of the number of square feet. Student's Solution: Let x be the size of the installation in square feet. 1. Land cost: 100x 2. Solar panel cost: 250x 3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000
ASSISTANT
The student's solution is correct.

But the student's solution is actually not correct! We can get the model to successfully notice this by prompting the model to generate its own solution first.

SYSTEM
First work out your own solution to the problem. Then compare your solution to the student's solution and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until you have done the problem yourself.
USER
Problem Statement: I'm building a solar power installation and I need help working out the financials. - Land costs $100 / square foot - I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot - I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square foot What is the total cost for the first year of operations as a function of the number of square feet. Student's Solution: Let x be the size of the installation in square feet. 1. Land cost: 100x 2. Solar panel cost: 250x 3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000
ASSISTANT
Let x be the size of the installation in square feet. 1. Land cost: 100x 2. Solar panel cost: 250x 3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 10x Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 10x = 360x + 100,000 The student's solution is incorrect. They made an error in the maintenance cost calculation, using 100x instead of 10x. The correct total cost for the first year of operations is 360x + 100,000.

#### Tactic: Use inner monologue or a sequence of queries to hide the model's reasoning process

The previous tactic demonstrates that it is sometimes important for the model to reason in detail about a problem before answering a specific question. For some applications, the reasoning process that a model uses to arrive at a final answer would be inappropriate to share with the user. For example, in tutoring applications we may want to encourage students to work out their own answers, but a model's reasoning process about the student's solution could reveal the answer to the student.

Inner monologue is a tactic that can be used to mitigate this. The idea of inner monologue is to instruct the model to put parts of the output that are meant to be hidden from the user into a structured format that makes parsing them easy. Then before presenting the output to the user, the output is parsed and only part of the output is made visible.

SYSTEM
Follow these steps to answer the user queries. Step 1 - First work out your own solution to the problem. Don't rely on the student's solution since it may be incorrect. Enclose all your work for this step within triple quotes ("""). Step 2 - Compare your solution to the student's solution and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. Enclose all your work for this step within triple quotes ("""). Step 3 - If the student made a mistake, determine what hint you could give the student without giving away the answer. Enclose all your work for this step within triple quotes ("""). Step 4 - If the student made a mistake, provide the hint from the previous step to the student (outside of triple quotes). Instead of writing "Step 4 - ..." write "Hint:".
USER
Problem Statement: <insert problem statement> Student Solution: <insert student solution>

Alternatively, this can be achieved with a sequence of queries in which all except the last have their output hidden from the end user.

First, we can ask the model to solve the problem on its own. Since this initial query doesn't require the student's solution, it can be omitted. This provides the additional advantage that there is no chance that the model's solution will be biased by the student's attempted solution.

USER
<insert problem statement>

Next, we can have the model use all available information to assess the correctness of the student's solution.

SYSTEM
Compare your solution to the student's solution and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not.
USER
Problem statement: """<insert problem statement>""" Your solution: """<insert model generated solution>""" Student's solution: """<insert student's solution>"""

Finally, we can let the model use its own analysis to construct a reply in the persona of a helpful tutor.

SYSTEM
You are a math tutor. If the student made an error, offer a hint to the student in a way that does not reveal the answer. If the student did not make an error, simply offer them an encouraging comment.
USER
Problem statement: """<insert problem statement>""" Your solution: """<insert model generated solution>""" Student's solution: """<insert student's solution>""" Analysis: """<insert model generated analysis from previous step>"""`,
